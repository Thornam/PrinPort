# Principal Portfolios

The repository creates a Python code for the paper "Principal Portfolio" by Bryan T. Kelly, Semyond Malamud, and Lasse Heje Pedersen [[1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jofi.13199)].

The code is based on the Proposition 11 from the paper:

## Code

The file "PrinPort" is a Python file with functions to create the Principal Portfolios, the Principal Exposure Portfolios, and the Principal Alpha Portfolios for a given set of return and signal vectors.

#### Replication
The folder "Replication" holds an early-stage version of the Python code that replicates some of the figures from the paper. It is based on section 5 in the paper, where Principal Portfolios are created on Fama-French data. This replication is merely created as a check for whether the underlying math within the code is constructed correctly.
